# Tree_Node_Finder
Searches a tree for a specfified node name

Nodes in tree are organized with a Name field (String) and Children,
    which is a list of all child nodes.
    
This program searches for a target node name, specified in the main function.

Logic: The algorithm is designed to recursively search each child in the Children array, 
       checking for equality in each child. Once a match is found, the function returns.
